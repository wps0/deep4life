        "Cell segmentation is usually the first step for downstream single-cell analysis in microscopy image-based biology and biomedical research. Deep learning has been widely used for cell-image segmentation.\n",
        "The CellSeg competition aims to benchmark cell segmentation methods that could be applied to various microscopy images across multiple imaging platforms and tissue types for cell Segmentation. The  Dataset challenge organizers provide both labeled images and unlabeled ones.\n",
        "The “2018 Data Science Bowl” Kaggle competition provides cell images and their masks for training cell/nuclei segmentation models.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2022 another [Cell Segmentation challenge was proposed at Neurips](https://neurips22-cellseg.grand-challenge.org/).\n",
        "For interested readers, the competition proceeding has been published on [PMLR](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v212/)\n",

        "### Project Description\n",
        "\n",
        "In the field of (bio-medical) image processing, segmentation of images is typically performed via U-Nets [1,2].\n",
        "\n",
        "A U-Net consists of an encoder - a series of convolution and pooling layers which reduce the spatial resolution of the input, followed by a decoder - a series of transposed convolution and upsampling layers which increase the spatial resolution of the input. The encoder and decoder are connected by a bottleneck layer which is responsible for reducing the number of channels in the input.\n",
        "The key innovation of U-Net is the addition of skip connections that connect the contracting path to the corresponding layers in the expanding path, allowing the network to recover fine-grained details lost during downsampling.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "At this [link](https://rpubs.com/eR_ic/unet), you find an R implementation of basic U-Nets. At this [link](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet), you find a Keras implementation of UNets.  \n",
        "Other implementations of more advanced UNets are also made available in [2] at these links: [UNet++](https://github.com/MrGiovanni/UNetPlusPlus)\n",
        "and by the CellSeg organizers as baseline models: [https://neurips22-cellseg.grand-challenge.org/baseline-and-tutorial/](https://neurips22-cellseg.grand-challenge.org/baseline-and-tutorial/)\n",

        "### Project aim\n",
        "\n",
        "The aim of the project is to download the *gray-level* (.tiff or .tif files) cell images from the [CellSeg](https://neurips22-cellseg.grand-challenge.org/dataset/) competition and assess the performance of an UNet or any other Deep model for cell segmentation.\n",
        "We suggest using gray-level images to obtain a model that is better specified on a sub class of images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Students are not restricted to use UNets but may other model is wellcome; e.g., even transformer based model in the [leaderboard](https://neurips22-cellseg.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/testing/leaderboard/) may be tested.\n",
        "Students are free to choose any model, as long as they are able to explain their rationale, architecture, strengths and weaknesses.\n",
